Multiplayer Modes:

		-players can either use a word to navigate or pass it to the other player for extra words and a hint of your location
-competitive
		-solo
	-challenge other player with pages
	-custom make words
	-Player is given 20 (or so) links and one of them is the correct page
		-Guessing incorrectly will give the player 3 (or so) more links
	
		-multi
	-half of words are yours and the other half are theirs
		-the correct answer is determined by a majority of links, so it can be stolen


-Both
	-half of words are yours and the other half are theirs, 
	 you need to figure out what yours is while possibly preventing them from doing so as well,
	 but you can both win by navigating to the same page
		-the correct answer is determined by a majority of links, so it can be stolen
	-players can win by solving their own page or by solving any of their opponents pages
	-wrong answer navigates to new page (correct answer is the same object with different text)
	-passed words can be "sent" back to give both players and extra link
