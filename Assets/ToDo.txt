Maybe look into an Algoritm to find important words in a wiki page
-play wikipedia race with all link text on a page
-rank link text by how specific it is to the main page (ie how far away it can get from main page)
	-how many pages away without being a page already visited by another node in the tree


Network Functionality (Scary) - Start with Hello World

Main Menu - Start with How to play 
-Play
	-list of ongoing games
	-new game
		-create
		-find
-Word Bank (only one, shared across games)
-How to play
-About

-Most viewed wiki pages


Bugs:

-Change text input box to off gray (maybe)
-Make different font
-Do something about pixelated circles
-Make words appear by a big bang effect and slowly expand logrithmically to their final position


Feedback:

-dragging is confusing
-text input box misclick
-competitive mode/challenge other player with pages/custom make words
