Maybe look into an AI to find important words in a wiki page
-play wikipedia race with all link text on a page
-rank link text by how specific it is to the main page (ie how far away it can get from main page)
	-how many pages away without being a page already visited by another node in the tree
-give new words to player when they meet some similarity to the page name/answer (ex 3 letters, correct first letter...)	
or
-give new words to player in return for banked words
or
-do it somewhat arbitrarily

Network Functionality (Scary) - Start with Hello World

Main Menu - Start with How to play 
-Play
	-list of ongoing games
	-new game
		-create
		-find
-Word Bank (only one, shared across games)
-How to play
-About (Game, Me {picture made of words[actual picture as gaslight joke or text picture]})

Bugs:

-Change text input box to off gray (maybe)
-Find different font
-Do something about pixelated circles
-Make words appear by a big bang effect and slowly expand logrithmically to their final position
